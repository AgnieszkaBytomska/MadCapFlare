        <p>Each player starts the game with six random cards. Players then take turns being the storyteller. The player whose turn it is to be storyteller looks at the six images in his or her hand. From one of these, he or she makes up a sentence or phrase that might describe it and says it out loud (without showing the card to the other players).</p>
        <p>Each other player then selects from among their own six cards the one that best matches the sentence given by the storyteller. Then, each player gives their selected card to the storyteller, without showing it to the others. The storyteller shuffles his or her chosen card with the cards received from the other players, and all cards are then dealt face up. The players (except for the storyteller) then secretly guess which picture was the storyteller's, using numbered voting chips.</p>
        <p><b>Scoring</b>
        </p>
        <p>Scoring according to Dixit revised rules</p>
        <p>The original rules were revised after publication.[2]</p>
        <p><b>If all players find the storyteller's card</b>
        </p>
        <p>Storyteller: 0 points</p>
        <p>Other players: 2 points</p>
        <p><b>If no players find the storyteller's card</b>
        </p>
        <p>Storyteller: 0 points</p>
        <p>Other players: 2 points (+1 bonus point per vote for his/her card)</p>
        <p><b>If at least 1 player, but not all players have found the storyteller's card</b>
        </p>
        <p>Storyteller: 3 points</p>
        <p>Players who found the card: 3 points (+1 bonus point per vote for his/her card)</p>
        <p>Other players: 0 points (+1 bonus point per vote for his/her card)</p>
        <p>In the original rules, players who did not find the storyteller's card were ineligible for bonus points. In the revised rules, the other players receive +1 bonus point per vote for his/her card.</p>
        <p>In the original rules, the winner is the first player to reach 30 points. In the revised rules, the winner is the player with the most points when the last card is drawn.</p>
